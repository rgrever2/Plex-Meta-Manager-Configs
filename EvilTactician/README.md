There was quite a bit of work involved in this - and you're welcome to use my assets and templates as you see fit as long as you give credit if you re-distribute them anywhere or include them in another project.

If you wish to say thanks, you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/eviltactician) or wave on Discord.
